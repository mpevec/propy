# Bulma Customization

Project was created by following instructions on [bulma site](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/).
Check the scripts part of the package.json for available commands.

## Important stuff

The end result is the css file, containing Bulma customizations, fontawesome-free and fonts, meaning the generated file
**css/propy-bulma-styles.css** needs to be copied in frontend app and thats it.
